### Learning Objectives:

In this part of the course, we will review the techniques necessary to obtain physical models of
the dynamic systems that we wish to control. These include model making for mechanical, electric, electromechanical, and a few other physical systems, including a simple model for a quadrotor drone, which will be used in subsequent parts.
