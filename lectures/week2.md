### Learning Objectives:

In this part of the course, we will discuss the analysis of dynamic response using Laplace transforms along with the relationship between time response and the poles and zeros of a transfer function.
We will also discuss the critical issue of system stability, including the Routh test.
An analysis of the effects of feedback on disturbance rejection, tracking accuracy, sensitivity to parameter changes, and dynamic response will be given. We will also give an elementary introduction to PID control.
